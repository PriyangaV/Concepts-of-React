/*
  @ JSX - Final
    $ It's a JS extension that provides syntactic sugar for function calls and object construction

    - It may look like a template engine or HTML, but it isn't

    ~ Makes code more easier to read and eloquent

    ^ Using JSX, we can modify our code easily if we're familiar with the standard HTML language

    ? Important benefit of using JSX is to write less code, which makes fewer mistakes and are less likely to develop repetitive-stree injuries

    # A small language with an XML-like syntax; but it has changed the way people write UI components

    * React fixes the broken separation of concerns (SoC) principle by bringing together the description of the UI and the JS logic

    & JSX code looks like HTMl and is easier to read and write

  @ How it works?
    ? It's compiled by various transformers into standard ECMAScript

    ~ JSX isn't a specification of ECMAScript, we're using babel to compile the JSX into JS

    ^ We call this process as Trans Compiling

  @ Transcompiler
    * Transcompiler is a type of compiler that takes the source code of a program written in one programming language as its input and produces the equivalent source code in another programming language

    $ User -> Transcompiler -> Js -> Browser
