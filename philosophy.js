/*
  @ React Philosophy

    * Functional Programming Patterns
      $ Stateful functions
      $ First class functions
      $ Higher order functions and immutability

    * Composition Over Inheritance
      $ React team chose a “powerful composition model” based on their experience with mixins
      $ Mixins substitutes for interfaces in other programming languages

    * JavaScript XML (JSX)
      $ One of JSX advantages is that it prevents injection attacks because “any values embedded in JSX are escaped before rendering them”
      $ It is a markup language and nothing more

    * ES5 and ES6
      $ It is best written with JavaScript ES6 but it has backward compatibility for ES5

    * Virtual DOM (React DOM)
      $ React has a Virtual DOM called React DOM which is the intermediary between React library and the browser DOM

    * Declarative Over Imperative Programming Paradigm
        $ Declarative programming is a programming paradigm … that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow
        $ Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state

    * Components: Class and Functional Components

    * Lifecycle Methods

    * PropTypes

    * DefaultProps

    * Error Boundaries

    * React Application Testing

    * Higher Order Components

    * Render Props

    * Context API

    * Redux

    * Server Side Rendering

    * Heuristic O(n) - diff algorithm ( to update the component tree )

    * React.Memo, useCallBack and Purecomponent to optimize component and prevent re-rendering which may be expensive
